# Nodejs Backend Challenge
​
## Objectives
​
The purpose of completing this test is to show us how you approach and solve a problem. 
​
- **State your assumptions.**  Anywhere you feel that the requirements are unclear please make
an assumption and document that assumption.
- **Describe Trade-offs.** When you are making a decision about using one design/approach vs. another
try to make a quick note about why you made the choice you did.
- **Provide tests.**  You should provide unit tests for the code that you write.

## Requirements
- Wakecap is an IoT company that has a products dealing with workers helmets to get data needed to track their movement and measure their productivity as well. The solution provides a lot of reports to the sites' admins and allow them to track their efficiently.
- The structure of each site is as following:
  - Client (Al Futtaim for example)
  - Al Futtaim has multiple sites (Like City Center)
  - Every Site has it's own workers
​
- For each site, there is a specific configuration:
  - Timezone (Used to manage the timing of the tracked workers against UTC)
  - Starting hour (Used to figure out the time the workers start their daily operation as Check In)
  - Ending hour (Used to figure out the time the workers end their daily operation as Check Out)
  - Late threshold (the Value where every worker exceeds the work shift interval they will be considered as late worker) 
 
  - We receive every 3 minutes new location update from our assets

        "duration" : 180,
        "worker_id" : "24",
        "generated_at": "1594106222000"
    }
    ````
    - coordinates: His location when this message is sent from the device 
    - is_active we have sensor detect if the worker is working or not
    - duration: number of seconds between sending this message and the pervious message.
    - generated_at: the time that the message generated on the device
